# [San Francisco Pizza]({{ '/' | relative_link }})

A list of pizza places in San Francisco, California.

This is meant to be a comprehensive and neutral list of pizza that can be found in San Francisco. Pizza places are
listed by neighborhood. Neighorhoods listed below are using the
borders [used by the SF Planning Department](https://sfplanninggis.org/neighborhoodorganizations/). This
is not the most comprehensive neighborhood list but was sufficient for use here. If a restaurant has more than 3
locations it's listed at the bottom in
[Multiple Locations](#multiple-locations) section.

Be sure to check the [**Types of Pizza**]({{ '/types-of-pizza/' | relative_link }}) page for an explanation of each style
of pizza.
