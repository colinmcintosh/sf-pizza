# [San Francisco Pizza]({{ '/' | relative_link }})

### ⚠️This is still a work in progress⚠️

A list of pizza places in San Francisco, California.

This is meant to be a comprehensive and neutral list of pizza that can be found in San Francisco. Pizza places are
listed by neighborhood. Neighorhoods below are using the
borders [defined by the SF Planning Department](https://sfplanning.org/resource/neighborhood-group-organizations). This
is not the most comprehensive neighborhood list but was sufficient for use here. If a restaurant has more than 3
locations it's listed at the bottom in
[Multiple Locations](#multiple-locations) section.

Be sure to check the [**Types of Pizza**]({{ 'TYPES_OF_PIZZA' | relative_link }}) page for an explanation of each style
of pizza.
