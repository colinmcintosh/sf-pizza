- name: California

    A thin-crust style of pizza that combines elements of many other styles of pizza.
    Topping are typically the same ingredients found in Californian cuisine such as artichoke,
    goat cheese, kale, beets, and nuts. California style pizza also usually has a low or no lip and
    topping will go nearly to the edge.

- name: Chicago deep-dish
  description: >
    Chicago style deep-dish pizza is thick pizza that's baked in a pan. Toppings are usually: sauce
    on the bottom, then vegetables or meat, then sauce on top. The crust is fried and flaky. Some
    people eat Chicago deep-dish pizza with a fork and knife because it's so bulky and messy.

- name: Chicago thin-crust
  description: >
    Chicago thin-crust style pizza (also known as "tavern style") is a thin-crust pizza that
    supposedly pre-dates Chicago deep-dish pizza, which is more famous. Dough for the pizza is
    rolled instead of tossed. The pizza is cooked until the crust is crispy and crunchy. Instead of
    triangle slices the pizza is cut into smaller squares -- good for sharing a single pie with
    more people.

- name: Detroit
  description: >
    Detroit style pizza is a rectangle shaped pizza that is baked in a steel pan. Wisconsin brick
    cheese is spread across the top of the tomato sauce all the way to the edge of the pan so that
    cheese drips down the sides and caramelizes as it cooks. This gives Detroit pizza a distinct
    crispy and chewy edge. Traditional Detroit style pizzas are made with the toppings in
    reverse order: cheese on the bottom, then meat and vegetables, then sauce on top; however
    Detroit pizza uses much less sauce that other styles of pizza so it may have a more typical
    cheesy pizza look or may look very saucy like Chicago deep-dish pizza.

- name: Grandma

    Grandma pizza (or "Grandma pie") is a rectangle shaped pizza with a thin crust. Grandma pizza
    is originally from Long Island, New York and was traditionally made at home in half-sheet pan
    in a regular home oven. Toppings are reversed: cheese is placed on the dough first then sauce
    on top of the cheese. Similar looking to Sicilian style pizza.

- name: Greek
  description: >
    Greek style pizza is a thin-crust pizza that is cooked in a shallow metal pan heavily coated
    with olive oil. The crust is a chewy texture similar to focaccia bread but more oily and less
    thick. (Note: currently I don't know any places serving Greek pizza in San Francisco).
